PHP Resources
=============

A curated PHP knowledge base — listing projects and the PHPeople behind. So far just a fuzzy idea.


## Motivation pitch

**[PHP the right way](http://www.phptherightway.com/)** is a great starting point for a modern PHP. It already offers a resources section, but probably that collection can be enhanced to an even wider scope?

Let's showcase the good PHP parts: initiatives, news, communities, podcasts, blogs, newsletters, frameworks, eCommerce, CMS, books, hosting, SaaS, user groups & meetups, conferences, tutorials …

There are already some similar websites out there, mostly out-of-date, incomplete, or even spammy (affiliate links, banners).

## Ideas

* text-file-based database to quickly add contents via pull request
* one scheme for all entries, connecting people with contents

## Continue

As much as we would like to continue this, we primarily need to focus on our [commercial hosting service](http://www.fortrabbit.com).

It takes a lot of efforts to do this project right. It needs a critical mass of contributers to live on. It's supposed to cover a lot of content, why only focus on PHP, why the almighty resource for everything? I don't know.

Take everything here, it's yours. I (frank) can support you gathering contents and maybe a bit of design.
